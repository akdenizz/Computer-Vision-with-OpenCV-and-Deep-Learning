# Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning
This repository contains files and codes which I learned from Datai Team's course in Udemy. I coded every lesson step by step and I decided to create this repo in the hope that it will be a resource for the people who is interested in. 

It contains a lot of file that you can try them on your own  and you can see the how fun it is.

## Indexes

1. Image Processing with OpenCV

  + Open Image --> It is about how you import an image
  + Video Camera --> You can import a video in real-time
  + Resize and Crop --> This is about how you can resize and crop  an image 
  + Shape and Text --> You can reshape and put a text on an image
  + Joining Images --> You can put the picture side by side horizontally or vertically
  + Warp Perspective --> You can change the warp perspective of the image(If the picture is warped, you can straighten it)
  + Blending --> You can blend the images
  + Image Thresholding --> You can apply a threshold or adaptive threshold of an image
  + Blurring --> You can blur the image by methods(Avarage/Gaussian/Median) that you want to apply
  + Morphological --> You can apply Morphological Operations(Erosion/Dilation/Opening/Closing/Morphological Gradient) that you want
  + Gradients --> You can use this in edge detection
  + Histogram --> You can make a histogram of an image and  you can do histogram equalization also
  + Example of Computer Vision --> You can do this yourself if you want , the only thing that you should do is delete the code and code the writings in comment lines
  
2. Object Detection with OpenCV 
  + Edge Detection
  + Corner Detection
  + Contour Detection
  + Ball Detection and Tracking
  + Template Matching --> This is a technique in digital image processing for finding small parts of an image which match a template image
  + Feature Matching --> It shows how to match features in one image with others. You can use Brute-Force Matcher with Sift or ORB 
  + Watershed --> This  is a classical algorithm used for segmentation, that is, for separating different objects in an image.
  + Face Detection
  + Cat Face Detection with Cascade
  + Custom Cascade
  + Pedestrian Detection OpenCV  
  + Example of Object Detection --> You can do this yourself if you want , the only thing that you should do is delete the code and code the writings in comment lines
  
3. Object Tracking with OpenCV
  + Meanshift and Camshift --> This  algorithms are used to track objects in videos
  + Other Tracking Algorithms --> You can find the necessary informations into the codes
  + Multiple Object Tracking 
  
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
  + T-Rex --> First, you collect data from screen by playing yourself then you train your trex model. Finally, your model plays itself ( It is really fun :))
  + Real-Time Digit Classification --> You can train your model and it detects digits using your camera
  
5. Object Detection with CNN
  + RCNN --> CNN with using ResNet Dataset and methods which are image pyramid, sliding window, non max supression..
  + SSD --> It divides the image using a grid and detects objects.
